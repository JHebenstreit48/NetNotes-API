## Hosts and Devices

<hr class="dividerSection" />

### Host
<hr class="dividerSubsection1" />

- Any device connected to a network that sends or receives data.
- Examples:
  - PCs
  - Macs
  - Smartphones
  - IoT devices

### Patch Cable
<hr class="dividerSubsection1" />

- A short Ethernet cable used to connect:
  - A switch to a router
  - A host (e.g., PC) to a switch
- Common categories:
  - <span class="codeSnip">Cat5e</span>
  - <span class="codeSnip">Cat6</span>
  - <span class="codeSnip">Cat6a</span>

## Ports and Connections

<hr class="dividerSection" />

### Router Port Naming
<hr class="dividerSubsection1" />

- Router interfaces commonly follow a format like:
  - <span class="codeSnip">GigabitEthernet0/0</span>
- The name typically reflects:
  - Interface type
  - Speed class
  - Slot / module / port position (vendor-dependent)

### Ethernet Ports
<hr class="dividerSubsection1" />

- A general term for ports that use Ethernet standards for Layer 2 connectivity.

### LAN Ports
<hr class="dividerSubsection1" />

- Ports intended for connecting devices within a Local Area Network.
- Often used as a label on consumer routers to distinguish internal ports from the WAN/uplink port.

### RJ-45 Ports
<hr class="dividerSubsection1" />

- Refers to the physical connector type commonly used for twisted-pair Ethernet.
- Commonly supports:
  - <span class="codeSnip">Cat5e</span>, <span class="codeSnip">Cat6</span>, <span class="codeSnip">Cat6a</span>

### SFP (Small Form-factor Pluggable)
<hr class="dividerSubsection1" />

- A port type and/or pluggable transceiver system used for flexible media choices.
- Common media options:
  - Fiber optic modules
  - Copper modules (including RJ45-based modules, depending on platform)

#### Types:

- <span class="codeSnip">SFP</span> - commonly up to 1 Gbps
- <span class="codeSnip">SFP+</span> - commonly up to 10 Gbps

### LC Connector
<hr class="dividerSubsection1" />

- <span class="codeSnip">LC</span> (Lucent Connector)
- Small form-factor fiber connector commonly used in high-density environments.

### SC Connector
<hr class="dividerSubsection1" />

- <span class="codeSnip">SC</span> (Subscriber/Standard Connector)
- Larger push-pull fiber connector commonly seen in older installs and some residential/structured cabling.

### Switch Ports
<hr class="dividerSubsection1" />

- A general term for physical interfaces on a switch.

### Access Ports
<hr class="dividerSubsection1" />

- Switch ports configured to carry traffic for a single VLAN (common end-host port behavior).
- Typically used for endpoints like PCs, printers, phones, and access points (depending on design).

### Console Ports
<hr class="dividerSubsection1" />

- Used for direct device management and initial configuration.
- Common connector types:
  - <span class="codeSnip">RJ45</span>
  - <span class="codeSnip">USB</span> (USB-A or USB-C)
