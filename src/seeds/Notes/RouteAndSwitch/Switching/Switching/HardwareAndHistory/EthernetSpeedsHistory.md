## Original Ethernet  
---

- Introduced in the <span class="emphasis">1970s</span> and formalized in <span class="emphasis">1983</span> under the IEEE 802.3 standard.
- Provided <span class="emphasis">10 Mbps</span> speed.

## Fast Ethernet  
---

- Introduced in <span class="emphasis">1995</span> under the IEEE 802.3u standard.
- Provided <span class="emphasis">10Ã—</span> the speed of the original Ethernet.

## Gigabit Ethernet  
---

- Introduced in <span class="emphasis">1999</span> under the IEEE 802.3ab standard.
- Marked the beginning of Gigabit-speed networking for mainstream use.

## 10 Gigabit Ethernet  
---

- Standardized in <span class="emphasis">2002</span> as IEEE 802.3ae.
- Designed for high-performance enterprise and data center use.

## 25 Gigabit Ethernet  
---

- Industry initiative launched in <span class="emphasis">2014</span> by the 25G Ethernet Consortium.
- Standardized as IEEE 802.3by on <span class="emphasis">June 30, 2016</span>.
- Provided a cost-effective upgrade path from 10 Gbps.

## 40 Gigabit Ethernet  
---

- Standardized in <span class="emphasis">2010</span> under IEEE 802.3ba.
- Combines four 10 Gbps lanes to reach 40 Gbps.
- Common in aggregation and core layers of large networks.

## 100 Gigabit Ethernet  
---

- Standardized alongside 40 Gbps Ethernet in <span class="emphasis">2010</span> under IEEE 802.3ba.
- Adopted in large-scale enterprise, backbone, and cloud environments.

## 50 Gigabit Ethernet  
---

- Standardized as IEEE 802.3cd on <span class="emphasis">December 5, 2018</span>.
- A midpoint between 40 and 100 Gbps, used in high-performance setups.

## 200 Gigabit Ethernet  
---

- Standardized as part of IEEE 802.3bs on <span class="emphasis">December 6, 2017</span>.
- Offers high capacity for advanced data center applications.

## 400 Gigabit Ethernet  
---

- Standardized alongside 200GbE under IEEE 802.3bs on <span class="emphasis">December 6, 2017</span>.
- Built for telecom backbones, cloud scale, and hyperscale data centers.

## 800 Gigabit Ethernet  
---

- Approved by the IEEE P802.3df Task Force on <span class="emphasis">February 16, 2024</span>.
- Targets 5G, AI infrastructure, and research networks.

## 1 Terabit Ethernet  
---

- Still under research and development.
- Meant to support future workloads like AI, IoT, and global hyperscale platforms.

## 1.6 Terabit Ethernet  
---

- Under development by the IEEE P802.3dj Task Force.
- Expected to be completed by <span class="emphasis">Spring 2026</span>.
- Will use 200 Gbps lanes for ultra-high-performance networking.
