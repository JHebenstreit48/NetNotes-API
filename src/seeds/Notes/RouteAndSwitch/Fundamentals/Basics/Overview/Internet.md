## Who Owns the Internet?
---

The **internet is not owned by any single individual or organization.** It is a **global collection of interconnected networks** that follow standardized communication protocols.

- It operates as a **"network of networks,"** where multiple smaller networks interconnect.
- **Data travels** through various technologies, including **fiber-optic cables, wireless transmission, and satellites**.

### **Who Regulates the Internet?**
---

Although no single entity owns the internet, **organizations help maintain its structure**:
- **ICANN:** Manages domain names and IP addresses.
- **IETF:** Develops and maintains internet communication standards.
- **IANA & Regional Internet Registries (RIRs):** Allocate IP addresses to ISPs.
<br><br>

### **How the Internet Works**
---

The internet allows **devices and networks** to exchange data efficiently.

1. **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)** provide access to homes and businesses.
2. **Packets of data** travel across interconnected networks, passing through multiple routing points.
3. **Websites, cloud applications, and databases** are hosted on **remote servers**.

<br><br>

### **Example: How a Webpage Loads**
1. A user enters www.example.com in a web browser.
2. The browser contacts a **DNS server** to retrieve the **IP address** of the website.
3. The request is routed across the **internet backbone** to the web server.
4. The web server responds, and the page is displayed.

*(For details on DNS, refer to the **DNS and Name Resolution** section.)*
