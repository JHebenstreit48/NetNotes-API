## Who Owns the Internet?
---

The **internet is not owned by any single individual or organization.** It is a **global collection of interconnected networks** that follow standardized communication protocols.

- It operates as a **"network of networks,"** where multiple smaller networks interconnect.
- **Data travels** through various technologies, including **fiber-optic cables, wireless transmission, and satellites**.

### **Who Regulates the Internet?**
---

Although no single entity owns the internet, **organizations help maintain its structure**:
- **ICANN:** Manages domain names and IP addresses.
- **IETF:** Develops and maintains internet communication standards.
- **IANA & Regional Internet Registries (RIRs):** Allocate IP addresses to ISPs.

### **How the Internet Works**
---

The internet allows **devices and networks** to exchange data efficiently.

1. **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)** provide access to homes and businesses.
2. **Packets of data** travel across interconnected networks, passing through multiple routing points.
3. **Websites, cloud applications, and databases** are hosted on **remote servers**.

### **Example: How a Webpage Loads**
1. A user enters www.example.com in a web browser.
2. The browser contacts a **DNS server** to retrieve the **IP address** of the website.
3. The request is routed across the **internet backbone** to the web server.
4. The web server responds, and the page is displayed.

*(For details on DNS, refer to the **DNS and Name Resolution** section.)*

### **The Role of ISPs and the Internet Backbone**

An <span class="emphasis">Internet Service Provider (ISP)</span> connects home and business networks to the global internet.

ISPs may be:
- Cable providers
- Telephone companies
- Cellular providers
- Independent providers leasing infrastructure

ISPs interconnect with other ISPs in a <span class="emphasis">hierarchical structure</span> to form the global internet.

At the highest level, major providers are connected through the <span class="emphasis">internet backbone</span> — a high-capacity network of fiber-optic links that connect major metropolitan areas worldwide.

Fiber-optic cables:
- Run underground across continents
- Run under oceans between continents
- Provide extremely high bandwidth and reliability

## Internet Connection Types

Internet connections vary in **speed, reliability, and infrastructure**.
