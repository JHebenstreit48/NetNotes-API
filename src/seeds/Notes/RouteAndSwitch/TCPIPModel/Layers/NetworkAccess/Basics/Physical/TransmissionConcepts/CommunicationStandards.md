## Communication Standards

---

### Why Standards Matter

Communication standards define shared rules so devices can transmit data in a compatible way.

Without standards, equipment from different vendors would not reliably communicate.

### Wired Communication Standards (Ethernet)

Most wired LANs use **Ethernet**, standardized by the IEEE under the **802.3** family.

Ethernet standards define things like:
- Physical media (copper or fiber)
- Link speed options
- Distance limitations
- Signaling requirements for the medium

### Wireless Communication Standards (Wi-Fi)

Wireless networking commonly uses **Wi-Fi**, standardized by the IEEE under the **802.11** family.

At the Physical layer, wireless uses the **air (RF)** as the transmission medium.

For deeper Wi-Fi concepts (802.11 details), see:

### Media vs Standards

- **Media** is the physical path (copper, fiber, air)
- **Standards** are the rules for how devices use that path

Both are needed for reliable communication.

### Summary

Communication standards provide:
- Interoperability between devices
- Predictable performance expectations
- A foundation for higher-layer networking
