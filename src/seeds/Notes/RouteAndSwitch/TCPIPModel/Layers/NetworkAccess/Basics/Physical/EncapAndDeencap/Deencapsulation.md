### What Is De-encapsulation?
---

De-encapsulation is the reverse process of encapsulation. It occurs when data is <span class="emphasis">received</span> and must be reconstructed for the application.

- Starts at the <span class="emphasis">Physical Layer</span> and moves upward.  
- Each layer removes its header/trailer, leaving the payload for the next layer.  
- Ends at the <span class="emphasis">Application Layer</span>, where the original data is presented.

### De-encapsulation Flow (Receive Path)

<div class="fullWidthBullet">

🔹 <span class="emphasis">Physical Layer</span> → receives raw bits, converts to frames  
🔹 <span class="emphasis">Data Link Layer</span> → validates FCS, strips MAC info  
🔹 <span class="emphasis">Internet Layer</span> → checks IP header, TTL, forwards payload  
🔹 <span class="emphasis">Transport Layer</span> → reassembles segments, checks ports  
🔹 <span class="emphasis">Application Layer</span> → presents usable data to the service

### Common Pitfalls in De-encapsulation
---

- <span class="emphasis">MTU mismatch</span> → fragmentation or dropped packets.  
- <span class="emphasis">Stale ARP cache</span> → wrong MAC resolution.  
- <span class="emphasis">Incorrect default gateway</span> → packets never leave subnet.  
- <span class="emphasis">Header corruption</span> → fails checksum, dropped at layer.
