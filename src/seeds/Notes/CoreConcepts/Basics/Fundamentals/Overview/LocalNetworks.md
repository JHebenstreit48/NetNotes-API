# Local Networks and Connectivity  
<br><br>

---
## **What Are Local Networks?**
---
A **local network** is a private network that connects devices within a limited area, such as a home, office, or campus.

- **Devices within a local network** can communicate **without using the public internet**.
- These networks allow **file sharing, resource sharing, and communication** between connected systems.

---
## **Types of Local Networks**
---
Local networks vary in **size, purpose, and infrastructure**.

## **Key Features of Local Networks**
---
Local networks offer **efficient communication** by keeping traffic **within a confined area**.

- **Shared Resources:** Printers, storage devices, and servers can be accessed by multiple users.
- **Internal Communication:** Employees or family members can send files and messages without needing the internet.
- **Security & Control:** Organizations can set up **firewalls, authentication methods, and encryption** to protect data.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Reduces the need for expensive external cloud services.

## **Enterprise vs. Small Networks**
---
Local networks can range from a **simple home setup** to **complex enterprise infrastructures**.

## **The Role of Local Networks in the Internet**
---
While **local networks** operate **independently**, they often connect to the **internet** for global communication.

- **LANs (Local Area Networks)** form the foundation of **businesses, schools, and homes**.
- **The internet itself is a network of interconnected LANs**.
