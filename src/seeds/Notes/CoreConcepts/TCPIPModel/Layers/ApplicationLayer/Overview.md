### What is the Application Layer
---  

The Application Layer in the TCP/IP model corresponds to **Layers 5, 6, and 7** of the OSI model. While the OSI model separates these into **Session**, **Presentation**, and **Application** layers, the TCP/IP model consolidates them into one unified layer.

This layer serves as the **interface between network services and applications**. It ensures users and applications can interact with the network, sending and receiving data seamlessly.
