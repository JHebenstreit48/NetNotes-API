## Data Transmission Methods

---

### From Bits to Signals

Once data is broken down into bits, it needs to be turned into signals that can travel across a network.

These signals travel over a medium, which could be:
- Copper wire
- Fiber-optic cable
- Wireless airwaves (radio, infrared, etc.)

Each method changes the data into a different kind of signal.

### What Is a Signal?

A **signal** is a pattern (electrical, optical, or wireless) that represents digital data.  
It moves from one device to another using a transmission medium.

Each signal type has its own way of carrying bits from source to destination.

### Common Signal Transmission Methods

Networks typically use one of three main transmission methods:

  <thead>
    <tr class="tableHeader">
      <th class="tableCellHeader">Method</th>
      <th class="tableCellHeader">How It Works</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell">Electrical Signals</td>
      <td class="tableCell">Bits are sent as electrical pulses across copper cables.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell">Optical Signals</td>
      <td class="tableCell">Bits are turned into light pulses and sent through fiber-optic cables.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell">Wireless Signals</td>
      <td class="tableCell">Bits are sent as radio waves, infrared, or microwaves through the air.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Signal Changes in Transit

Signals may change type several times during transmission.

For example:
- A message might start as electrical on copper,
- Convert to light in a fiber core,
- Then switch to wireless before reaching the end device.

This happens because different segments of the network use different media.

### Common Transmission Types

In everyday networks:

- **Homes and small offices** often use:
  - **Copper cables** (Ethernet)
  - **Wi-Fi** (wireless)

- **Large networks and data centers** often use:
  - **Fiber-optic** connections for speed and distance

Each method is chosen based on:
- **Distance**
- **Speed requirements**
- **Cost**
- **Environment**

### Summary

- Data is sent as signals over a medium (cable or air).
- Signals can be electrical, optical, or wireless.
- Networks choose the signal type based on performance needs.
- Signals may change forms multiple times before reaching their final destination.
