### Wireless Spectrum Basics
---

Wireless networking technologies use portions of the <span class="emphasis">electromagnetic spectrum</span> to transmit data without physical cables.

Different technologies operate at different frequencies depending on:

- Required range  
- Throughput needs  
- Regulatory rules  

Certain parts of the spectrum can be used without a license, provided devices follow power and protocol limitations.

### Licensed vs Unlicensed Spectrum
---

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Spectrum Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Licensed</td>
    <td>Reserved and regulated for specific providers (e.g., cellular networks).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unlicensed</td>
    <td>Open for public use under defined rules (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Most home wireless technologies operate in <span class="emphasis">unlicensed bands</span>.

### Common Home Wireless Bands
---

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Frequency Band</th>
    <th>Common Uses</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2.4 GHz</td>
    <td>Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n), Bluetooth</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5 GHz</td>
    <td>Wi-Fi (802.11 a/n/ac/ax)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The 2.4 GHz band:

- Provides greater range  
- Has fewer non-overlapping channels  
- Is often more congested  

The 5 GHz band:

- Supports more non-overlapping channels  
- Offers higher throughput potential  
- Typically has shorter range than 2.4 GHz  

---
### Bluetooth vs Wi-Fi in the 2.4 GHz Band
---

Both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi may operate in the 2.4 GHz band, but they are designed differently.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Technology</th>
    <th>Design Goal</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bluetooth</td>
    <td>Low power, short range, device-to-device connectivity</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Wi-Fi (802.11)</td>
    <td>Higher power, LAN access, internet connectivity</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Bluetooth uses low-speed, short-range communication and supports connecting multiple peripherals simultaneously.

Wi-Fi devices transmit at higher power levels, enabling:

- Greater coverage area  
- Higher throughput  
- Infrastructure-based networking  

---
### Channels Within Frequency Bands
---

Each frequency band is divided into smaller segments called <span class="emphasis">channels</span>.

Channels allow multiple wireless networks to operate within the same band.

Proper channel selection helps reduce:

- Interference  
- Overlapping transmissions  
- Performance degradation  

Channel planning becomes increasingly important in dense environments such as apartments or offices.

---
### Why Band Selection Matters
---

Selecting between 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz impacts:

- Speed  
- Range  
- Interference levels  
- Device compatibility  

Modern routers often support <span class="emphasis">band steering</span>, which encourages capable devices to use 5 GHz when available.
