# Networking Models

## What Is a Networking Model?
---

A <span class="emphasis">networking model</span> provides a structured way to understand how networks are organized and how devices interact.

Models help explain:
- how communication is structured
- how responsibilities are divided
- how networks scale
- how complexity is managed

---

## Network Scale and Design
---

Different environments require different network designs.

<table class="notesTable">
  <thead>
    <tr class="tableHeader">
      <th class="tableCellHeader">Environment</th>
      <th class="tableCellHeader">Characteristics</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell">Home Network</td>
      <td class="tableCell">Small scale, few devices, often combined router/AP/modem</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell">Enterprise Network</td>
      <td class="tableCell">Large scale, many devices, specialized hardware roles</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Enterprise networks separate functions across dedicated devices to improve:
- performance
- reliability
- security
- scalability

## Traffic and Security Differences
---

<table class="notesTable">
  <thead>
    <tr class="tableHeader">
      <th class="tableCellHeader">Factor</th>
      <th class="tableCellHeader">Typical Difference</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell">Traffic Volume</td>
      <td class="tableCell">Enterprise networks handle heavy, continuous traffic</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell">Security Needs</td>
      <td class="tableCell">Enterprises require advanced filtering and segmentation</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Evolving Network Design
---

Modern networking continues to evolve.

Common trends include:
- <span class="emphasis">AI-driven optimization</span>
- <span class="emphasis">Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 7</span>
- <span class="emphasis">5G integration</span>
- cloud-managed infrastructure

As networks grow more complex, structured models become increasingly important.

---

## Why Models Matter
---

Networking models prepare you for deeper frameworks such as:

- The <span class="emphasis">OSI Model</span>
- The <span class="emphasis">TCP/IP Model</span>

They provide a logical way to:
- break networking into layers
- troubleshoot systematically
- separate hardware and software responsibilities

---

## Summary
---

- Networking models organize how networks are structured.
- Home and enterprise environments differ significantly.
- Larger networks require dedicated infrastructure.
- Layered models allow complex systems to be understood logically.
