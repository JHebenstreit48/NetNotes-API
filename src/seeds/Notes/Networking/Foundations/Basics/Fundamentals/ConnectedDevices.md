### What Are Connected Devices?

---

A <span class="emphasis">connected device</span> is any device that communicates on a network using wired or wireless connectivity.

In a home or small office environment, most connected devices are considered <span class="emphasis">end hosts</span> because they generate or consume data rather than forwarding traffic for other devices.

These devices connect to the <span class="emphasis">LAN (Local Area Network)</span> side of a router or switch.

### Common Types of Connected Devices

---

Home and small office networks commonly include:

- Desktop computers  
- Laptops  
- Gaming consoles  
- Smart TVs  
- Printers and scanners  
- Security cameras  
- Smart speakers  
- Telephones (VoIP or Wi-Fi calling)  
- Climate control systems (smart thermostats)  
- Mobile devices (smartphones and tablets)  

As new technologies emerge, more household functions rely on network connectivity for monitoring, automation, and remote control.

### Wired vs Wireless Devices

---

Connected devices may attach to the network in different ways:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Connection Type</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Wired (Ethernet)</td>
    <td>Connected using an RJ45 Ethernet cable to a LAN port on a router or switch.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Wireless (Wi-Fi)</td>
    <td>Connected through the router’s built-in wireless access point.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In most home networks, wired and wireless devices share the same LAN and can communicate with each other directly.

### Infrastructure vs End Devices

---

Not all devices on a network serve the same purpose.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Device Category</th>
    <th>Purpose</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>End Devices</td>
    <td>Generate and consume data (PCs, TVs, phones, IoT devices).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Infrastructure Devices</td>
    <td>Forward, manage, or secure traffic (routers, switches, access points).</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Infrastructure devices connect networks together, while end devices primarily use network services.

### Growth of IoT in Home Networks

---

Modern networks increasingly support <span class="emphasis">Internet of Things (IoT)</span> devices.

Examples include:

- Smart lighting systems  
- Smart locks  
- Video doorbells  
- Environmental sensors  
- Voice assistants  

The growth of IoT increases:

- The number of connected devices  
- Bandwidth demand  
- Security considerations  

As networks expand, proper segmentation and secure configuration become more important.

### Relationship to WLAN

---

In home environments, many devices connect wirelessly using a <span class="emphasis">Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)</span>.

Wireless devices:

- Associate with a wireless access point  
- Receive an IP address from the router  
- Join the same local network as wired devices (by default)
