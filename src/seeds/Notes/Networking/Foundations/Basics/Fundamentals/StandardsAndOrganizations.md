## Why Standards Matter
---

With the increasing number of new devices and technologies coming online, how is it possible to manage all the changes and still reliably deliver services such as email?

The answer is **internet standards**.

A **standard** is a set of rules that determines how something must be done. Networking and internet standards ensure that all devices connecting to the network implement the same set of rules or protocols in the same manner.

Using standards, it is possible for different types of devices to send information to each other over the internet.

For example, the way in which an email is formatted, forwarded, and received by all devices is done according to a standard. If one person sends an email via a personal computer, another person can use a mobile phone to receive and read the email as long as the mobile phone uses the same standards as the personal computer.

## How Internet Standards Are Created (RFCs)
---

An internet standard is the end result of a comprehensive cycle of **discussion, problem solving, and testing**.

When a new standard is proposed, each stage of the development and approval process is recorded in a numbered **Request for Comments (RFC)** document so that the evolution of the standard is tracked.

RFCs for internet standards are **published and managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)**.

## Common Standards Bodies (High-Level)
---

Different organizations support standards across different parts of networking.

Examples include:

- **IETF** — publishes RFCs and standardizes many core internet protocols.
- **IEEE** — defines many LAN/WLAN technical standards (ex: 802.3 Ethernet, 802.11 Wi-Fi).
- **ICANN** — coordinates global domain names and IP-related resources.
- **IANA** — manages core internet registries (IP allocations, protocol parameters, etc.).
- **ITU** — develops global telecom standards (especially carrier / international telecom space).
- **TIA** — defines many cabling and physical infrastructure standards (ex: wiring specs).
