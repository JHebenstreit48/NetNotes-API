  - IoT devices

---

### Patch Cable

- A short Ethernet cable used to connect:
  - A switch to a router
  - A host (e.g., PC) to a switch
- Common types include:
  - **Cat5e**
  - **Cat6**
  - **Cat6a**

---

## Ports and Connections

---

### Router Port Naming

Routers use interface names such as:

- **GigabitEthernet0/0**

The name reflects:

- Interface type
- Speed capability
- Logical position

---

### Ethernet Ports

- General term for ports on switches or routers that use Ethernet standards.

---

### LAN Ports

- Ports specifically used for connecting devices within a Local Area Network.

---

### RJ-45 Ports

- Refers to the physical connector type (8P8C) used for twisted-pair Ethernet.
- Commonly supports Cat5e, Cat6, and Cat6a cabling.

---

### SFP (Small Form-factor Pluggable)

- A port or pluggable module supporting:
  - RJ45 copper modules
  - Fiber optic modules
  - Specialized high-speed copper modules

Types:

- **Standard SFP** → Up to 1 Gbps
- **SFP+** → Up to 10 Gbps

---

### LC Connector

- Lucent Connector
- Small form factor fiber optic connector used in high-density environments

---

### SC Connector

- Subscriber Connector
- Larger push-pull fiber connector commonly found in older or residential installations

---

### Switch Ports
