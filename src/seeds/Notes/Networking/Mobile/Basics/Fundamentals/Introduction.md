## Mobile Devices & Wireless Communication
---

Mobile devices give us the freedom to work, learn, play, and communicate from almost anywhere.

People using mobile devices do not need to be tied to a physical location to send and receive voice, video, and data communications.  
Wireless facilities (such as internet cafés) and wireless networks on college campuses allow users to:

- sign up for classes
- watch lectures
- submit assignments
- complete tasks in areas where physical network connections are unavailable

With mobile devices becoming more powerful, many tasks that once required large computers connected to physical networks can now be completed using mobile devices on wireless networks.

## Multiple Radios, Multiple Networks
---

Modern smartphones contain multiple built-in radios that allow them to connect to different types of networks.

Unlike a laptop that primarily connects using Wi-Fi, a smartphone is designed to communicate using several wireless technologies at the same time.

These radios enable the phone to:

- Make voice calls
- Access the internet using a data plan
- Connect to Wi-Fi networks
- Pair with accessories
- Determine location
- Make contactless payments

Each function uses a different wireless technology.

## Radios Inside a Smartphone
---

A typical smartphone includes:

- **Cellular radio** – Connects to mobile carrier networks (4G / 5G)
- **Wi-Fi radio** – Connects to local wireless networks (WLAN)
- **Bluetooth radio** – Connects to nearby accessories
- **NFC radio** – Enables short-range communication for payments
- **GPS receiver** – Determines geographic location using satellites

These radios operate independently but may function simultaneously.

## Wi-Fi vs Cellular Data
---

Almost all mobile devices are capable of connecting to Wi-Fi networks.

It is advisable to connect to Wi-Fi when possible because:

- data used over Wi-Fi does **not** count against the cellular data plan
- Wi-Fi radios usually use **less power** than cellular radios, which helps conserve battery life

---
## Wi-Fi Security on Mobile Devices
---

Like other Wi-Fi-enabled devices, it is important to use security when connecting to Wi-Fi networks.

Precautions to protect Wi-Fi communications include:

- Never send login or password information using unencrypted text (plaintext).
- Use a VPN connection when possible if you are sending sensitive data.
- Enable security on home networks.
- Use WPA2 or higher encryption for security.

---
## Why Multiple Radios?
---

Different wireless technologies are optimized for different purposes:

- Long-range wide-area coverage → Cellular
- Local internet access → Wi-Fi
- Short-range device pairing → Bluetooth
- Very short-range secure exchange → NFC
- Global positioning → GPS

Understanding which radio is used for each service helps explain how mobile devices communicate.
