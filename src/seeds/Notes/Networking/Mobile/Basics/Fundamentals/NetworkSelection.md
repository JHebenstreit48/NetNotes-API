### Network Selection & Wi-Fi Connection Behavior

---

Two of the most popular operating systems for mobile devices are **Android** and **Apple iOS**. Each operating system has settings that enable you to configure your device to connect to wireless networks.

When an Android or iOS device is within the coverage range of a Wi-Fi network:

- Turn on Wi-Fi.
- The device searches for available Wi-Fi networks and displays them in a list.
- Touch a Wi-Fi network in the list to connect.
- Enter a password if needed.

When a mobile device is out of range of the Wi-Fi network:

- It attempts to connect to another Wi-Fi network in range.
- If no Wi-Fi networks are available, it connects to the cellular data network.

When Wi-Fi is on, the device automatically reconnects to any Wi-Fi network it has connected to previously.  
If the network is new, the device may display a list of available networks or ask if it should connect.

### SSID and Passphrase Basics
---

A mobile device connects to a Wi-Fi network using two main pieces of information:

- <span class="emphasis">SSID</span> (the wireless network name)
- <span class="emphasis">Passphrase</span> (the wireless password)

Both must be entered exactly as configured on the wireless router.

If they are entered incorrectly, the device will not connect properly.

If a mobile device does not prompt to connect to a Wi-Fi network:

- the SSID broadcast may be turned off  
- the device may not be set to connect automatically  

In these cases, you may need to manually configure the Wi-Fi settings on the device.
