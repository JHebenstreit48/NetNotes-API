## Coverage & Data Plans
---

Cellular performance depends on several factors:

- Signal strength
- Distance from the cell tower
- Network congestion
- Carrier infrastructure

---

### Coverage Areas

Carriers divide regions into **cells**, each served by a tower.

When moving between cells, the phone performs a **handoff**, maintaining active connections without interruption.

---

### Data Plans

Mobile data plans determine:

- Monthly data limits
- Speed tiers
- Throttling thresholds
- Roaming policies

When not connected to Wi-Fi, internet traffic uses the cellular data plan.

---

Cellular networks provide wide-area connectivity but may be affected by:

- Terrain
- Building materials
- Network congestion
