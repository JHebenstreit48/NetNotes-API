## Cellular Networks
---

Cellular networks allow mobile devices to communicate over large geographic areas.

A smartphone connects to nearby cell towers operated by a mobile carrier. These towers provide:

- Voice communication
- Text messaging
- Mobile data services

Unlike Wi-Fi, cellular networks are managed by telecommunications providers.

### How Cellular Communication Works

1. The phone connects to the nearest cell tower.
2. The tower connects to the carrier’s core network.
3. The carrier routes traffic to:
   - Other phones
   - The public telephone network
   - The internet

This infrastructure allows users to communicate across cities, states, and countries.
