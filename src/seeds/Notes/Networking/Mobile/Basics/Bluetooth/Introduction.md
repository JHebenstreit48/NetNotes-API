### Bluetooth Introduction

---

Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology that allows devices to connect to each other and to nearby accessories.

Cellular and Wi-Fi connections can be difficult to configure and often require additional infrastructure (such as towers and access points).  
Cable connections are not always practical when connecting headsets, speakers, or other peripherals.

Bluetooth provides a simple connection method that is:

- <span class="emphasis">wireless</span>
- <span class="emphasis">automatic</span>
- <span class="emphasis">low power</span> (helps conserve battery life)

Up to <span class="emphasis">eight</span> Bluetooth devices can be connected together at one time.

Bluetooth is commonly used on smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktops for short-range accessory and device connections.
