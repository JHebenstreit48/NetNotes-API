### Pairing & Profiles

---

Bluetooth <span class="emphasis">pairing</span> occurs when two Bluetooth devices establish a connection to share resources.

To pair devices:

- Bluetooth radios must be turned on.
- One device searches for other devices.
- The other device must be set to <span class="emphasis">discoverable mode</span> (also called <span class="emphasis">visible</span>) so it can be detected.

When a Bluetooth device is in discoverable mode, it can transmit information when another device requests it, such as:

- Name
- Bluetooth class
- Services the device can use
- Technical information (such as supported features or the Bluetooth specification level)

---

### PIN / Passkey Authentication

---

During pairing, a <span class="emphasis">PIN</span> may be requested to authenticate the pairing process.

- The PIN is often a number, but it may also be a numeric code or passkey.
- Once paired, the PIN is stored so it does not have to be entered again for future connections.

This is convenient for accessories such as headsets, which may automatically connect when powered on and within range.
