# Terminating Ethernet

## Proper Termination

---

Proper termination is important for reliable Ethernet connections.

Key requirements:

- Connectors must be fully seated
- Wires must reach the end of the connector
- Wire order must match T568A or T568B
- Cable jacket should be secured inside the connector

Poor termination can cause:

- Link failures
- Packet loss
- Reduced speeds
- Intermittent connectivity

## Basic Termination Steps

---

Typical steps for terminating an Ethernet cable:

1. Strip the outer jacket
2. Untwist wire pairs
3. Arrange wires in the correct order
4. Trim wires evenly
5. Insert into RJ45 connector
6. Crimp connector
7. Test the cable
