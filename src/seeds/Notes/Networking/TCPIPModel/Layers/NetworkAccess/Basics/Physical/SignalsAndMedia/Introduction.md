## Layer 1: Physical Layer — Introduction

---

### What Is the Physical Layer?

Layer 1 represents the **physical components** used to transmit data across a network.

This includes:
- Physical media
- Electrical, optical, or wireless signals
- Connectors and interfaces

At this layer, data exists only as **bits**.

---

### Media Types

The physical layer transmits data using different media:

- **Copper cables** (electrical signals)
- **Fiber-optic cables** (light signals)
- **Wireless airwaves** (radio, infrared, microwave)

Each medium has unique properties that affect speed, distance, and reliability.

---

### Signals

A **signal** is the physical representation of binary data.

Depending on the medium, signals may be:
- Electrical pulses
- Light flashes
- Radio waves

These signals carry bits from one device to another.

---

### Relationship to Layer 2

Once bits arrive at a device:
- Layer 1 delivers raw bits upward
- Layer 2 interprets them as frames

Layer 1 does **not** understand addresses, frames, or protocols — only signals.

---

### Summary

The Physical Layer defines **how bits move**.

Without Layer 1, no higher-layer communication can occur — regardless of protocol or addressing.
