## Layer 1: Physical Layer — Bit & Digital Signals

---

### What Is a Bit?

A <span class="emphasis">bit</span> (binary digit) is the smallest unit of data in a network.

At the physical layer, a bit is represented by a **physical state**, such as:

- High or low voltage (electrical)
- Light on or off (fiber)
- Presence or absence of radio energy (wireless)

Bits do not exist as numbers at this layer — they exist as measurable physical changes.

### Digital Signaling

Most modern networks use <span class="emphasis">digital signaling</span>.

Digital signals use discrete states to represent:

- 0
- 1

This differs from analog signaling, which uses continuously varying signals.

### How Devices Interpret Bits

To interpret bits correctly, devices must agree on:

- Voltage or light thresholds
- Timing (clock synchronization)
- Signal encoding format

If timing or voltage levels are misaligned, errors can occur.

### Signal Challenges

Physical signals can degrade due to:

- Distance
- Interference (noise)
- Crosstalk
- Attenuation

Because of this, physical layer standards define limits for:

- Cable length
- Transmission power
- Shielding requirements

---

### Why This Matters

Without reliable bit transmission:

- Frames cannot form
- Addresses cannot be read
- Higher-layer protocols cannot function

All networking depends on stable digital signaling at Layer 1.
