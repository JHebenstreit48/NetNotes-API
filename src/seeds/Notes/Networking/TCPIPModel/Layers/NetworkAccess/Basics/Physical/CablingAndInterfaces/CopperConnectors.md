### Copper Ethernet Connectors

---

Copper Ethernet cables use a standardized connector commonly referred to as:

- RJ45  
- 8P8C (8-position, 8-contact)

RJ45 is the common physical connector used for twisted-pair Ethernet cabling.

### Plug vs Jack

    <td>Jack</td>
    <td>The female connector found on switches, routers, wall plates, and patch panels</td>

Plugs insert into jacks to complete the connection.

### Where RJ45 Connectors Are Used

---

RJ45 connectors are commonly found on:

- Switch Ethernet ports
- Router LAN ports
- Wall outlets
- Patch panels
- Desktop network interface cards (NICs)

---

### Termination Standards

---

Ethernet twisted pair cabling is terminated using wiring standards such as:

- T568A
- T568B

These standards define the order of the wire pairs inside the connector.

### Keystone Jacks and Patch Panels

---

Structured cabling installations often use:

- Keystone jacks (in wall plates)
- Patch panels (in racks)

These allow permanent cabling to terminate cleanly and connect to switches using patch cables.

---

### Electrical Signaling

---

Copper Ethernet uses:

- Electrical voltage changes
- Balanced signaling across twisted pairs

Because copper carries electrical current, it is:

- Susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI)
- Limited by signal attenuation over distance
