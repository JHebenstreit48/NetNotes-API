### Fiber Optic Media
---

Fiber optic cable is a transmission medium that carries data using <span class="emphasis">light pulses</span> rather than electrical signals.

Unlike copper-based media, fiber does not conduct electricity.

Fiber is commonly used in:

- Enterprise backbone links  
- Data centers  
- ISP infrastructure  
- Fiber-to-the-Home (FTTH) deployments  

---
### Structure of Fiber Cable
---

A fiber optic cable consists of:

<table class="notesTable">
  <thead>
    <tr class="tableHeader">
      <th class="tableCellHeader">Component</th>
      <th class="tableCellHeader">Purpose</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell">Core</td>
      <td class="tableCell">Glass or plastic strand that carries light signals</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell">Cladding</td>
      <td class="tableCell">Reflects light back into the core</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell">Buffer Coating</td>
      <td class="tableCell">Protects the fiber strand</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell">Outer Jacket</td>
      <td class="tableCell">Physical protection</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Light is kept inside the core through <span class="emphasis">total internal reflection</span>.

### Single-Mode vs Multi-Mode Fiber
---

<table class="notesTable">
  <thead>
    <tr class="tableHeader">
      <th class="tableCellHeader">Type</th>
      <th class="tableCellHeader">Characteristics</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell">Single-Mode (SMF)</td>
      <td class="tableCell">Long-distance transmission using a narrow core</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell">Multi-Mode (MMF)</td>
      <td class="tableCell">Shorter-distance transmission with wider core</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Single-mode fiber:

- Supports longer distances  
- Used in ISP and long-haul links  

Multi-mode fiber:

- Used in buildings and data centers  
- Lower cost optics for shorter runs  

---
### Fiber Connectors
---

Common fiber connectors include:

- <span class="emphasis">LC (Lucent Connector)</span>
- <span class="emphasis">SC (Subscriber Connector)</span>
- ST (Straight Tip) in legacy systems

LC connectors are commonly used in:

- SFP modules  
- High-density switch ports  

SC connectors are often found in:

- Older installations  
- Some residential ONT connections  

---
### Transceivers (SFP Modules)
---

Fiber interfaces typically require pluggable transceivers.

Common module types:

<table class="notesTable">
  <thead>
    <tr class="tableHeader">
      <th class="tableCellHeader">Module</th>
      <th class="tableCellHeader">Typical Speed</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell">SFP</td>
      <td class="tableCell">1 Gbps</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell">SFP+</td>
      <td class="tableCell">10 Gbps</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell">SFP28</td>
      <td class="tableCell">25 Gbps</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The transceiver converts:

- Electrical signals from a switch  
- Into optical signals for transmission  

And vice versa.

### How Signals Travel in Fiber
---

Fiber transmits data as pulses of light generated by:

- Laser diodes (long distance)  
- LEDs (short distance)

Light pulses represent digital bits:

- Light on → 1  
- Light off → 0  

Because fiber does not use electrical current:

- It is immune to electromagnetic interference (EMI)  
- It is not affected by electrical noise  
- It does not radiate signals  

---
### Why Fiber Scales Better
---

Compared to copper-based media:

- Fiber supports significantly higher theoretical bandwidth
- Fiber experiences lower signal attenuation over long distances
- Fiber is more secure against signal tapping
- Fiber does not suffer from electrical interference

In residential deployments:

- Fiber may terminate at an <span class="emphasis">Optical Network Terminal (ONT)</span>
- The ONT converts light signals into Ethernet
