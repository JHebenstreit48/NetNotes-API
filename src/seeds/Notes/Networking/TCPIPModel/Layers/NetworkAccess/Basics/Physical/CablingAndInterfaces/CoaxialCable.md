### Coaxial Cable

<hr class="dividerSection" />

Coaxial cable is a copper-based transmission medium commonly used for cable television, broadband internet (DOCSIS), and satellite communication systems.

Unlike twisted-pair Ethernet cabling, coaxial cable uses a single solid copper core to carry signals.

### Coaxial Cable Structure

A coaxial cable consists of:

      <th class="tableCellHeader">Purpose</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell">Copper Core</td>
      <td class="tableCell">Carries the electrical signal</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell">Dielectric Insulation</td>
      <td class="tableCell">Separates core from shielding</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell">Braided / Foil Shield</td>
      <td class="tableCell">Protects against electromagnetic interference (EMI)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="tableRow">
      <td class="tableCell">Outer Jacket</td>
      <td class="tableCell">Physical protection</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The shielding allows coaxial cable to carry high-frequency broadband signals with reduced interference.

### Common Coaxial Connectors

<hr class="dividerSection" />

Common connector types include:

- <span class="emphasis">F-Type</span> – Common in cable TV and cable internet installations  
- <span class="emphasis">BNC</span> – Used in legacy networking and some specialized equipment  

These connectors attach to the solid copper core and shielding to complete the signal path.

### Where Coax Is Used Today

<hr class="dividerSection" />

Coaxial cable is commonly used for:

- Cable television systems
- Cable broadband (DOCSIS)
- Satellite communication systems
- Some legacy Ethernet deployments

In modern home networks, coax typically terminates at a <span class="emphasis">cable modem</span>, which converts the signal into Ethernet for LAN use.
