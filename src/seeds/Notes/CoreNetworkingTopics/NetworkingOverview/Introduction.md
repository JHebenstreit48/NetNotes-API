# Introduction to Networking

## What is Networking?
---
Networking is the process of **connecting devices** to share <span class="emphasis">data</span> and <span class="secondEmphasis">resources</span>. It enables **communication and collaboration** between users and systems across small or large distances.

Devices in a network take on one of two main roles:
- <span class="emphasis">Client</span>: Requests <span class="secondEmphasis">services</span> or <span class="secondEmphasis">data</span>.
- <span class="emphasis">Server</span>: Provides <span class="secondEmphasis">services</span> or <span class="secondEmphasis">data</span>.

**Real-World Examples:**
- A **printer** on a home network allows multiple devices to send print jobs wirelessly.
- A **company network** enables employees to share files and access cloud-based applications.
- **Online gaming servers** connect players from around the world.

## Network Types Overview
---

Different network types are used depending on the **size, coverage area, and purpose** of the network.

<table class="notesTable">
    <thead>
        <tr class="tableHeader">
            <th class="tableCellHeader">Network Type</th>
            <th class="tableCellHeader">Coverage Area</th>
            <th class="tableCellHeader">Example Use</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr class="tableRow">
            <td class="tableCell">LAN (Local Area Network)</td>
            <td class="tableCell">Within a home, school, or office</td>
            <td class="tableCell">Connecting computers in a school</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="tableRow">
            <td class="tableCell">WAN (Wide Area Network)</td>
            <td class="tableCell">Covers large geographical areas</td>
            <td class="tableCell">The internet, a corporate global network</td>
        </tr>
        <tr class="tableRow">
            <td class="tableCell">MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)</td>
            <td class="tableCell">Covers a city or large campus</td>
            <td class="tableCell">University networks, municipal networks</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## The Client-Server Model
---
1. <span class="emphasis">Clients</span>: Initiate <span class="secondEmphasis">communication</span> by making **requests** (e.g., opening a **webpage** or accessing a **shared file**).
2. <span class="emphasis">Servers</span>: Respond to these **requests**, providing <span class="secondEmphasis">data</span> or <span class="secondEmphasis">resources</span>.

**Real-World Example:**
- A **web browser (client)** requests a webpage from a **web server**.
- A **company laptop** accesses a shared document from a **file server**.
