# Evolution of Ethernet Speeds  
<br>

## Original Ethernet (10 Mbps)  
---

- Introduced in the **1970s** and formalized in **1983** under the IEEE 802.3 standard.
- **Mbps** stands for **Megabits per second**, where:
  - **Mega** = 1 million.
  - **Bit** = the smallest unit of data in computing.
- **10 Mbps** means the network can transfer **10 million bits per second**.

## Fast Ethernet (100 Mbps)  
---

- Introduced in **1995** under the IEEE 802.3u standard.
- **100 Mbps** = 10 times the speed of the original Ethernet.

## Gigabit Ethernet (1000 Mbps or 1 Gbps)  
---

- Introduced in **1999** under the IEEE 802.3ab standard.
- **Gbps** stands for **Gigabits per second**, where:
  - **Giga** = 1 billion.
  - **Bit** = the smallest unit of data in computing.
- **1 Gbps** means the network can transfer **1 billion bits per second**.

## 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10,000 Mbps or 10 Gbps)  
---

- Standardized in **2002** as IEEE 802.3ae.
- **10 Gbps** = **10 billion bits per second**.
- Primarily used in data centers and enterprise networks.

## 25 Gigabit Ethernet (25,000 Mbps or 25 Gbps)  
---

- Industry initiative launched in **2014** by the 25G Ethernet Consortium.
- Standardized as IEEE 802.3by on **June 30, 2016**.
- Provides a cost-effective upgrade path from 10 Gbps.
- Commonly used in modern data centers for server connections.

## 40 Gigabit Ethernet (40,000 Mbps or 40 Gbps)  
---

- Standardized in **2010** under IEEE 802.3ba.
- Combines **four 10 Gbps lanes** to achieve its speed.
- Used in aggregation and core networking in data centers.

## 100 Gigabit Ethernet (100,000 Mbps or 100 Gbps)  
---

- Standardized alongside 40 Gbps Ethernet in **2010** under IEEE 802.3ba.
- **100 Gbps** = **100 billion bits per second**.
  - A major leap for large-scale enterprise and cloud data centers.
  - Commonly used for backbone links and high-end computing clusters.

## 50 Gigabit Ethernet (50,000 Mbps or 50 Gbps)  
---

- Standardized as IEEE 802.3cd on **December 5, 2018**.
- An intermediary step offering greater speeds than 40 Gbps but below 100 Gbps.
- Increasingly popular in high-performance networking setups.

## Beyond 100 Gigabit Ethernet  
---

- **200 Gigabit Ethernet (200GbE):**  

  - Standardized as part of IEEE 802.3bs on **December 6, 2017**.
  - Offers a balance between cost and performance for advanced data center deployments.  

- **400 Gigabit Ethernet (400GbE):**  

  - Standardized alongside 200GbE under IEEE 802.3bs on **December 6, 2017**.
  - Used in hyperscale data centers, telecom providers, and high-speed research networks.  

- **800 Gigabit Ethernet (800GbE):**  

  - Approved by the IEEE P802.3df Task Force on **February 16, 2024**.
  - Targets advanced networking environments like AI and 5G infrastructure.  
  
## Terabit Ethernet (1 Tbps and Beyond)  
---

- **1 Tbps (1 trillion bits per second)**  

- 1 Tbps and higher are under research and development.
- The IEEE P802.3dj Task Force is also working on standards for 1.6 Tbps Ethernet.
- Promises to handle the increasing demands of global data traffic, including AI, IoT, and hyperscale data centers.
- Expected to be the backbone for future-proofing networks in the coming decades.  

- **1.6 Terabit Ethernet (1.6TbE):**  

- Under development by the IEEE P802.3dj Task Force, expected to be completed by **Spring 2026**.
- Focuses on leveraging 200Gbps lanes for ultra-high-performance networking.
