## What is Wireshark?
Wireshark is a <span class="emphasis">network protocol analyzer</span> used for:
- <span class="emphasis">Troubleshooting</span> network issues.
- <span class="emphasis">Analyzing</span> traffic flow and patterns.
- <span class="emphasis">Debugging</span> communication protocols.

It allows users to monitor and inspect network traffic in real time or from previously captured packets.

## Search Filters
Filters in Wireshark help narrow down specific types of traffic for analysis. Examples of display filters include:
- <span class="emphasis">DNS</span>: Enter <span class="emphasis">dns</span> to filter and display only DNS traffic.
- <span class="emphasis">HTTP</span>: Enter <span class="emphasis">http</span> to view all HTTP traffic.

Filters make it easier to pinpoint issues or focus on specific protocols in large data captures.

## Key Features
Wireshark offers several powerful features, including:
1. **Traffic Analysis**:
   - Analyze <span class="emphasis">real-time traffic</span> or load <span class="secondEmphasis">recorded traffic</span> for deeper inspection.
2. **Protocol Decoding**:
   - Decode various <span class="emphasis">protocols</span> and examine details at different network layers.
3. **Custom Filters**:
   - Apply filters based on criteria like <span class="emphasis">IP</span>, <span class="secondEmphasis">port</span>, and <span class="secondEmphasis">protocol</span>.
4. **Specific Traffic Isolation**:
   - Focus on certain protocols, such as <span class="emphasis">DNS</span> or <span class="secondEmphasis">HTTP</span>.

## Navigating Packets
Wireshark allows users to navigate packet details, including:
- **Answer RRs (Resource Records)**: Found in DNS responses, they contain key resolution data.
- **Hyperlinked Packet Responses**: Useful for tracing specific traffic flows or relationships between packets.

These features are essential for diagnosing and resolving complex network issues.

## Use Cases
Wireshark is versatile and applicable in various scenarios, such as:
1. **Diagnosing Network Latency**:
   - Identify bottlenecks or delays in communication.
2. **Troubleshooting DNS Issues**:
   - Analyze <span class="emphasis">DNS requests</span> and <span class="secondEmphasis">responses</span> for errors.
3. **Monitoring TCP/UDP Traffic**:
   - Inspect specific <span class="emphasis">TCP</span> or <span class="secondEmphasis">UDP</span> sessions to ensure proper data flow.
4. **Application-Layer Verification**:
   - Verify that <span class="emphasis">HTTP</span>, <span class="secondEmphasis">HTTPS</span>, or other application protocols are functioning correctly.
